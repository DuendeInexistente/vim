# camfowler's minimal Vim

The focus is on a powerful environment, without replacing any core functionality of Vim itself. For example, autocomplete in Vim is baked in and it is great!

If you think this config is missing something, have a good search over the build in tools in Vim - you may be surprised!

These simple commands will get you vimming in no time:

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/camfowler/vim.git ~/.vim

# Install or update plugins
~/.vim/pack/install.sh
```

Enjoy!
